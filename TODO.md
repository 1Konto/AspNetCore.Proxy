TODO:
  * Test coverage.
  * Test for round robin.
  * XML docs.
  * Add options for WebSocket calls.


NEW TODO:
  * Generally rethink `RunProxy` since it doesn't need a route...and args do not make sense.
  * `RunProxy` should also always forward the `**rest`...and it doesn't now.
  * It looks like `RunProxy` needs its own proxy class.
  * Same for other helpers like `ProxyAsync`?
